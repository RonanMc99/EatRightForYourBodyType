            <p class="lead mb-0">It's easy to see that we are all built a little differently - some people are thinner and leaner, some are naturally muscular while others are broader and tend to carry more weight around the middle.<br></p>
            <p class="lead mb-0 my-3">Most people think that body types are just about appearance, but this is not correct.&nbsp; In fact, your body type can tell you a lot about your athletic strengths and weaknesses, your hormone profile and how you respond to certain types of food.<br></p>
            <p class="lead mb-0 my-3">By adjusting your diet to match your individual body type, you can lower your body fat and increase muscle mass.  As a result, you will improve your sports performance and your overall health!&nbsp; Lets get started...</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3 display-4">Types of Food</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Before we talk about the specifics of body type eating, it's useful to describe the foundations of a healthy diet.&nbsp; Assuming you already eat lots of vegetables (which provide essential fibre, vitamins and minerals), there are three main categories of food which we need to fuel activity and rebuild our bodies - you've heard of them before.&nbsp; They are:&nbsp; Protein, Carbohydrates and Dietary Fats</p>
          </div>

          <div class="p-5 col-lg-6 order-1 order-sm-1 justify-content-center">
            <h3 class="mb-3 display-4">Protein</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Protein is incredibly important for all body types.&nbsp; The word comes from the Greek 'Protos' meaning 'first' or 'most important one'.&nbsp; Everyone should eat enough protein, but especially us active, sporty people, who may need more than others.&nbsp; It's really important to prioritise eating sufficient protein, which you can find in foods like meat, seafood, beans and pulses, soya, eggs, dairy products, nuts and cereal grains.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="p-5 col-lg-6 order-1 order-sm-1 justify-content-center">
            <h3 class="mb-3 display-4">Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Carbohydrates are the primary source of fuel for most people.&nbsp; You body likes to burn carboydrates as they are easily broken down for energy.&nbsp; It's important to know that each body type differs in their carb tolerance.&nbsp; Some people tend to burn them off, while others store them as fat!&nbsp; Good souces of carbs include oats, wholegrain bread, rice, beans, lentils, potatoes, corn as well as many vegetables and fruits.</p>

          <div class="p-5 col-lg-6 order-1 order-sm-1 justify-content-center">
            <h3 class="mb-3 display-4">Dietary Fats</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0">As well as being an alternative energy source to carbohydrates, dietary fats are incredibly important for making new cells, for immunity, and for your nervous system. The fats you eat literally become part of you, so it's important your diet includes a range of healthy fats from natural sources, such as oily fish, eggs, olive oil, coconut, flax, chia, nuts &amp; seeds and grass-fed dairy.</p>

            <p class="my-4 text-muted">Ectomorphs tend to be lean, with long and slender limbs. These are our typical long-distance runners and may refer to themselves as 'Hard-gainers' at the gym.&nbsp;Very often, they want to gain some weight, add more muscle and strength, perhaps to 'fill out' their legs or arms.  They may also want to fuel their endurance performance.&nbsp;Ectomorphs tend to be 'high-energy' people with a faster metabolic rate, and may be someone who eats a lot yet never seems to put on any weight!&nbsp;If you would like to learn more about this body type, and get specific diet recommendations, click download below!</p>

            <p class="my-4 text-muted">Mesomorphs have a medium frame and are generally muscular.&nbsp;They tend to be our 'natural athletes' and find it easy to put on muscle and stay leaner, but can add fat if they overeat or stop training.&nbsp;Mesomorphs are great at sports which require explosive strength and power, such as gymnastics, and martial arts.  Body builders are often also natural mesomorphs.&nbsp;Becuase of this tendancy to gain weight, Mesomorphs must match their calorie intake to their activity level.&nbsp;If you would like to learn more about this body type, and get specific diet recommendations, click download below!</p>

            <p class="my-4 text-muted">Endomorphs have a larger frame and tend to carry more body fat and are heavier overall.&nbsp;These are the rugby players, powerlifters and wrestlers.&nbsp;Endomorphs tend to be less active and don't burn off excess calories easily, which then gets stored as body fat. Because of this, they have a lower tolerance for carbohydrates.&nbsp;Counterintuitively, they actually tend to do much better with a higher percentage of dietary fat, as well as more protein, and lower carbohydrates.&nbsp;If you would like to learn more about this body type, and get specific diet recommendations, click download below!</p>
