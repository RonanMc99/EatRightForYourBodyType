# Eat Right For Your Body Type
## An informational website for athletic/sports people who want to refine their diet to match their body type 
This project was created as part of the Usercentric Frontend module of the [Fullstack Developer training at Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma-uk)

## UX
The user experience was about providing information in a clear and non-technical way for the user, and to provide a practical way to move forward.  
It aimed to outline what body types are, and what the user can do with this knowledge.
The user will also be able to download a PDF to get a more detailed explanation of their body type and some nutritional guidelines.

During the design phase of this project, I decided that the visual design would use illustrations of the different body types in order to explain each one visually.  This is a fast way to explain a complex list of characteristics.  The accompanying text would then provide additional clarification and detail for the user.  The layout would be a simple, one-page scrolling design, which uses a mobile-first approach to responsive design.  This adds to the simplicity of use.

A navigation bar at the top would provide jump-links to each section, so that a user could easily find the information they wanted, which is especially important on subsequent visits to the site.  It also would include a prominent call-to-action, which is the primary aim of the site's interaction with the business - to apply for a free consultation.

The free consultation is the only CTA on-page, as this leads the user to that one, single outcome - to interact with the business and become a client.

On that basis, I created a list of requirements:

## Requirements:
1. Explain the concept of body types and the three main categories using a description and image
2. Explain each body type's characteristics, so that the user can identify which type they are
3. Provide suggestions for how the user can adapt their diet to suit their individual body type
4. Provide additional information for people who don’t fall neatly into one of the 3 main categories
5. Explain the limitations of the body type model and why it’s not a ‘final destination’.  A person can always improve their body composition despite their body type
6. Allow visitors to download a PDF with some simple guidelines for body-type eating
7. Provides an option to sign up for a nutritional consultation if they want to know more (contact form) **Note: Functionality for this form is out of scope as the project is a User-Centric Frontend Development Project i.e. HTML/CSS only.**  This button could be linked to JS or a 3rd party autoresponder at a later date
8. Has social sharing links
9. Includes a disclaimer

On the basis of these requirements, a wireframe was created.  The first version was determined to be too 'text-heavy' and so a second version was created that replaced text with an explainer video.  [View the wireframe here:] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VlI0Lawn036panhtLn8AMDetkrfStmhq)

## Features
- At the top, there is navigation bar with jump-links and a prominent button that links to the CTA section on the page.  The nav items have a hover over effect which scales them up and makes it easier to see which option you are selecting.  The button has a shadow effect applied.  This nav bar collapses to the 'hamburger' icon on smaller screens for a better UX on mobile.
- The site has a hero-style image at the top of the page, with a strapline that describes what the site is about and who it is for.
- It has a 60 second explainer video which explains the site's purpose in a little more detail in an easily-digestible way.
- The next section talks about the different types of food.  
- There is a section that describes each body type, and provides a download link to a customised PDF for that body type.
- There is a section that explains why your body type does not define you, and that you can change your appearance through diet.  It also provides additional information and advice for people who don't fit neatly into one of the body type categories.
- A call-to-action where the user can submit their email address and receive a free consultation.
- A footer section with disclaimer and social sharing links.

## Technologies Used
This site was build using HTML 5 and CSS 3 with Boostrap 4 for styling and layout

## Testing
I tested this site using the requirements document listed above - checking off each one steo-by-step.  I then worked through the page from top to bottom, making sure all links and other functionality was working correctly.  The page's responsive design, layout and functionality was checked using Chrome developer tools.
